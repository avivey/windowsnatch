WINUSB support
====================================

After making this work, I learnt that the Raw HID feature has essentially all
the features I want (ie, no driver + low level packet communications). I also
don't know how to make the WinUSB stuff compatible with the rest of the code, so
I'm just going to leave this like this in case I need to one day to WinUSB for
some other reason.

Building
========

Get the compiler: `arm-none-eabi-*`.
- Install (untar) Aruduino IDE. Install (via wizard) the Teensyduino add-on.
- the compiler should be in `/hardware/tools/arm/`.
- simlink `./tools/` to that tools directory (or copy that in).

To flash the device, either get `teensy_reboot` and `teensy_post_compile` (I
didn't try those), or find `teensy_loader_cli` in Teensy's website.

============

- Teensy's website and Teensyduino provide some example Makefile, and the Core
  code.
- `teensy-core` appears to be from github/PaulStoffregen/cores@eae654412c893
- github/apmorton/teensy-template provides help in the code layout,
  and is the origin of my Makefile
- http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/ is a good source about USB protocol
- Microsoft's docs are on par with other MS docs.
- https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/WCID-Devices has good explanation about
  building a WINUSB device.
- http://libusb.info/ - on linux, run `xusb` as root to debug a usb device that
  isn't playing nice. I couldn't find a way to do this in Windows.
