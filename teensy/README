Teensy 3.6 Pet Project
====================================

Building
========

Get the compiler: `arm-none-eabi-*`.
- Install (untar) Aruduino IDE. Install (via wizard) the Teensyduino add-on.
- the compiler should be in `/hardware/tools/arm/`.
- simlink `./tools/` to that tools directory (or copy that in).

To flash the device, either get `teensy_reboot` and `teensy_post_compile` (I
didn't try those), or find `teensy_loader_cli` in Teensy's website.

Bibliography
============

- Teensy's website and Teensyduino provide some example Makefile, and the Core
  code.
- `teensy-core` is from github/PaulStoffregen/cores@25d2728d7cb0
- github/apmorton/teensy-template provides help in the code layout,
  and is the origin of my Makefile
- http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/ is a good source about USB protocol
- Microsoft's docs are on par with other MS docs.
- https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/WCID-Devices has good explanation about
  building a WINUSB device.
- http://libusb.info/ - on linux, run `xusb` as root to debug a usb device that
  isn't playing nice. I couldn't find a way to do this in Windows.

Todo
====
- The makefile just takes all the core and libs and links them in the elf/hex -
  that's redundant. Figure out a way to minimize size of build.
